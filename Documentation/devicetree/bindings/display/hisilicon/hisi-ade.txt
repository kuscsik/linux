Device-Tree bindings for hisilicon ADE display controller driver

ADE (Advanced Display Engine) is the display controller which grab image
data from memory, do composition, do post image processing, generate RGB
timing stream and transfer to DSI.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be "hisilicon,hi6220-ade".
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- reg-names: name of physical base.
- interrupt: the interrupt number.
- clocks: the clocks needed.
- clock-names: the name of the clocks.
- assigned-clocks: clocks to be assigned rate.
- assigned-clock-rates: clock rates which are assigned to assigned-clocks.
- port: the output port. This contains one endpoint subnode, with its
  remote-endpoint set to the phandle of the connected DSI endpoint.
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt for more device graph info.

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent.


A example of HiKey board hi6220 SoC specific DT entry:
Example:

	ade: ade@f4100000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi6220-ade";
		reg = <0x0 0xf4100000 0x0 0x7800>,
		      <0x0 0xf4410000 0x0 0x1000>,
		      <0x0 0xf4520000 0x0 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "ade_base",
			    "media_base",
			    "media_noc_base";

		interrupts = <0 115 4>; /* ldi interrupt */

		clocks = <&media_ctrl HI6220_ADE_CORE>,
			 <&media_ctrl HI6220_CODEC_JPEG>,
			 <&media_ctrl HI6220_ADE_PIX_SRC>;
		/*clock name*/
		clock-names  = "clk_ade_core",
			       "clk_codec_jpeg",
			       "clk_ade_pix";

		assigned-clocks = <&media_ctrl HI6220_ADE_CORE>,
			<&media_ctrl HI6220_CODEC_JPEG>;
		assigned-clock-rates = <360000000>, <288000000>;
		dma-coherent;

		port {
			ade_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&dsi_in>;
			};
		};
	};
