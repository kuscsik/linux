Device-Tree bindings for DesignWare DSI Host Controller v1.20a driver

A DSI Host Controller resides in the middle of display controller and external
HDMI converter.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be "hisilicon,hi6220-dsi".
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- clocks: the clocks needed.
- clock-names: the name of the clocks.
- ports: contains DSI controller input and output sub port. The input port
  connects to ADE output port, and output port connected to external HDMI
  endpoint. See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt for more device
  graph info.

A example of HiKey board hi6220 SoC and board specific DT entry:
Example:

SoC specific:
	dsi: dsi@0xf4107800 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi6220-dsi";
		reg = <0x0 0xf4107800 0x0 0x100>;
		clocks = <&media_ctrl  HI6220_DSI_PCLK>;
		clock-names = "pclk_dsi";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				dsi_in: endpoint {
						remote-endpoint = <&ade_out>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>; /* 1 for output port */
				dsi_out: endpoint {
						 remote-endpoint = <&adv7533_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

Board specific:
	i2c2: i2c@f7102000 {
		...

		adv7533: adv7533@39 {
			...

			port {
				adv7533_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&dsi_out>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
